# MPCUtils4J &nbsp; ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
A Java library containing math, stream, ... util classes that I used to work with MPC protocols during my PhD.
<br>This project mainly exists to make my life easier (so that I don't have to copy-paste code), but feel free to use it if you want.
